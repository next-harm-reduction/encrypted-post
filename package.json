  "description": "1. Create a google spreadsheet where the encrypted submissions will go. 2. Go to Tools->ScriptEditor and paste in `Code.gs` content 3. Edit the bottom where the Spreadsheet url token is and put the token of the spreadsheet 4. Publish -> Deploy as webapp, with *Execute As* as the spreads    heet owner and *Who has access*:Anyone 5. Copy the Current web app url for a later step (Step 7) 6. Generate a Private/Public key pair as described in the jsencrypt project:    * From here: [https://github.com/travist/jsencrypt#how-to-use-this-library](https://github.com/travist/jsencrypt#how-to-use-this-library)    * Ideally you would do this step on a air-gapped laptop, and then copy the public key part from that laptop to      another where you would do step 7, but Step 8 would be done on the air-gapped laptop. 7. Edit index.html:    * Replace the public key at the bottom of index.html with the generated public key.    * Change the script.google.com url at the bottom with the one copyied from Step 5.      Append the current suffix so that the line still ends with ?fielddata=`';` 8. Edit decrypt.html:    * Replace the private key in the file with the one generated. 9. Adjust and install the index.html somewhere on the web.",
